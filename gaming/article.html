                    <h4>Manor Land</h4>
                    <p>The best medieval-ish city builder. I happen to be a historian specialising
                        in the Middle Ages, and games that market themselves as “historically authentic” 
                        often leave a lot to be desired as such games often don’t even try to emulate the time 
                        period beyond basic aesthetics. This game, although there is room for improvement, is clearly 
                        an earnest attempt to enable players to recreate reasonably authentic medieval towns and villages and 
                        gets closer to that goal than any of its rivals. After spending about a dozen hours building a 
                        large town, it's very much unfinished but what's there is good.

                        There is currently one map with some RNG elements, such as your starting location and the starting 
                        location of a rival lord who also wants this land and whom you will eventually have to fight. 
                        You will build houses which can, as was typical in the Middle Ages, have a productive plot of land to 
                        the rear for a vegetable garden or household animals like goats or a chicken coop, and the system for 
                        building them is intuitive, flexible, and a joy to use. You’ll have to manage trade with off-map 
                        settlements as well as maintain a militia to deal with bandits or the rival lord. On the whole, 
                        I really like it.</p>

                    <h4>Elden Ring</h4>
                    <p>Elden Ring was my first soulslike.
                        It was kinda overwhelming when starting but I had tons of fun in my first blind run.
                        Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game.
                        You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world, enjoy the view and smaller bosses.
                        The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere in-game. You're not forced to farm 
                        the same enemies for hours on until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will 
                        eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave 
                        it be for now and do hundreds of other things instead.</p>

                    <h4>Anotheer crab's treasure</h4>
                    <p>A phenomenal spin on the Souls/like. You almost forget its a souls game until a crab decides to insta kill 
                        you and you loose 26k microplastics and hate the universe. Its wonderful</p>

                    <h4>Sandland</h4>
                    <p>I haven’t watched through all of the gameplay yet. However, it greatly expands 
                        the worldview of the original manga with many new exciting elements. It is 
                        high-quality as a stand alone game and I can tell it is a highly satisfying action-RPG game!

                        First of all, the graphics have an excellent balance of the atmosphere of the 
                        manga and its drawing style. The representation looks great. The game will surely 
                        provide you an exciting experience with a genuine sense of design and attention 
                        to detail, from the many new vehicle designs, various customizations, as well 
                        as the background design!
                        
                        In the game, there is not only the world of Sand Land, but also a new world called 
                        Forest Land with new characters, which were not in the manga. You can enjoy a more 
                        substantial story, and a vast map to adventure while playing as the Fiend Prince.
                        
                        I myself can only play casual games, but I do check out the trending games my family 
                        plays, and I think I know a little something about them even for an old man. I seriously 
                        recommend the game Sand Land</p>

                        monitor. Now I know why my attention span is getting shorter lmao</p>
